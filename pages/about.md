# About Me

## Well, just a little

I received my PhD in Philosophy with a focus on moral philosophy from Florida State University in 2015. I taught at a community college for a year after graduating but, because of complications related to my disability, I was forced to leave academia. 

Never one to accept defeat (for too long, at least) and anticipating my departure from academia, I began teaching myself Web Development and quickly fell head over heal in love with JavaScript. Over the past year I've been building little things here and there for myself and fun, occasionally doing some freelance work, and trying to learn more about Web Development and Software Engineering in general. I'm currently looking for more remote opportunities in Web Development or Consulting.

Apart from philosophy and web development, I'm a big fan of my beloved Wife, our two dogs, and our two cats.
